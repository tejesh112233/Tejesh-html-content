	<p>Luffy's first bounty is 30,000,000 Berries, which he receives after defeating Buggy, Don Krieg, and Arlong of East Blue. His second bounty is significantly higher, at 100,000,000 Berries, after defeating Crocodile of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Luffy receives his third bounty of 300,000,000 Berries, after rampaging at Enies Lobby and retaking Nico Robin. His subsequent bounty of 400,000,000 Berries, is mainly given to him because of his defeat of another Warlord of the Sea, Gecko Moria, and his participation in the Summit War of Marineford. After the time skip, Luffy grows more powerful and receives a bounty of 500,000,000 Berries, after defeating a third Warlord, Donquixote Doflamingo. After defeating Charlotte Cracker and Charlotte Katakuri, two of the Big Mom Pirate's top-ranking members, with bounties of 800,000,000 and 1,057,000,000 Berries respectively, and having gone against Big Mom, one of the Four Emperors, he received a bounty of 1,500,000,000 Berries, one of the highest known bounties in the One Piece world. After Luffy defeated Kaido and Big Mom together with Kidd and Law, his bounty increased to 3,000,000,000 berries, and he became one of the Four Emperors in the New World.[9]</p>

	<p>When Eiichiro Oda created Luffy, he strove for a "manliness" similar to that of Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball series.[12] Oda said that he named his main character "Luffy" because he felt that the name suited him. When he later learned about the sailing term, "luffing", he was delighted by the coincidence.[13] In his prototype one-shot, "Romance Dawn", Oda refined the artistic style and story elements before publishing the final product a year later as the first chapter of One Piece. In the second version of "Romance Dawn", Luffy resembled his design at the beginning of the series.[14] After the one-shot of One Piece was made, Oda contacted his former mentor, Nobuhiro Watsuki, whom he assisted in making the manga Rurouni Kenshin. Watsuki was pleased with Luffy's characterization and advised Oda to briefly change him for the main series to make it look like Luffy is always acting on his own free will.[15] To please his readers, Oda added rubberization to Luffy for comic effect[13] and tries to make the character straightforward.[16] In retrospect, Watsuki felt characters like Luffy reflect a trend of heroes who do not kill their enemies similar to his character Himura Kenshin.[17]</p>
	<h3 id="Appearances"></h3>
	<p>Luffy first appears as a young boy in Windmill Village located in the Goa kingdom, who befriends the pirate "Red-Haired" Shanks and intends to become one himself. He accidentally eats the Human Human fruit, model: "Nika" fruit and acquires rubber powers at the cost of being unable to swim. Luffy is later saved at sea by Shanks from being devoured by a Sea King, a large sea beast, but costs Shanks his left arm due to it being eaten by the beast in the encounter. Ten years later, Luffy leaves the village in a small fishing boat in search of the legendary treasure 'One Piece' and to become King of the Pirates, while doing so he encounters the same Sea King that almost ate him 10 years ago, Luffy knocks it out in a single punch to avenge Shanks. He meets swordsman Roronoa Zoro, ocean navigator and thief Nami, cowardly marksman and liar Usopp, and chivalrous chef Sanji and invites them to join his crew. Luffy also encounters and defeats the East Blue pirate Buggy the Clown and the Fishman Arlong, becoming known to the general populace and the pirate-hating Marines, such as Captain Smoker.</p>
